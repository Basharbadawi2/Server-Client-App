Single-Player Game Application
Description
This project implements a single-player game application where a client interacts with a central server. The game logic is managed on the server, allowing the client to play and communicate with the server.

Features
Server-Client Communication: The server acts as a central hub, facilitating communication with a single client.
Game Logic on Server: All game logic, including player interactions and state management, is handled on the server to ensure consistency.
Scalable Architecture: Designed with scalability in mind to support potential expansion to multiple clients in the future.
